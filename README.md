## Needleman-Wunsch implementation in python. 

The program takes sequences as input by either from an file or just arguments. 

### Usage: 
* For taking sequences from a file, the relative file path should be given.

	`python aligment.py <path-of-input-file>`

* For taking sequences as arguments, sequences should be given. 			

	`python alignment.py <sequence1> <sequence2> <sequence3>`
